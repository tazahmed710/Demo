                    <p style="font-size: 1.25rem;">This is a smart robotic system. While we can use at the entrance of
                        school, college,
                        office-court. At the gate. A smart robotic system that can detect the temperature of a person
                        entering through an entrance and detect a face mask, meaning that the person is wearing a mask.
                        Also, if the person's temperature is 100 and if the person is not wearing a face mark, he will
                        be barred from entering. If 99 or less and if he is wearing face maten he will be allowed to
                        enter and show him Auto Present. During the current Corona period, the re-opening of various
                        institutions, including educational institutions, has greatly increased the chances of being
                        infected with Corona. Therefore, the measurement program has been introduced in various
                        institutions including educational institutions. Which is mainly being performed by teachers in
                        educational institutions and various employees in other institutions. In that case, there is a
                        strong possibility that teachers and staff will be affected by corona. But if we use robotics
                        systems or robots instead of them, then they will be largely risk-free. It is ab seen that
                        Finger Print Machine is used as an attendant in many educational institutions and different
                        institutions. Even then There is a strong possibility of being infected with corona. We don't
                        have that risk because we have Auto Present system in this robotic system. This smart robotic
                        system has the function of Temperature Detect. It uses Arduino Mega. Also used is Serbo Motor.
